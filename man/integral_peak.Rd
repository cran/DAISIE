\arguments{
\item{logfun}{the logarithm of the function to integrate}

\item{xx}{the initial set of points on which to evaluate the function}

\item{xcutoff}{when the maximum has been found among the xx, this parameter sets the width of the interval to find the maximum in}

\item{ymaxthreshold}{sets the deviation allowed in finding the maximum among the xx}

\item{...}{any arguments of the function to optimize}

the result of the integration
